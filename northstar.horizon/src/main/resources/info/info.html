<p>This application implements an emulator for the NorthStar Horizon
	S-100 bus based Z-80 computer system from the late 1970's. This
	includes support for the ScreenSplitter video card that was sold by
	what was then Micro Diversions and later Scion corporation.</p>

<p>You must have a boot disk image in drive 1 to be able to use the
	emulator. If no image is mounted when booting, then the emulator will
	automatically switch to a paused mode until you correct this and
	reboot, or un-pause manually (with less than useful results).</p>

<p>While you can boot any NorthStar compatible 'NSI' format disk,
	unless you boot with one that has output support for the
	ScreenSplitter, you will only be able to use the text console.</p>

<p>
	Here is some history about NorthStar computers: <a

<h1>The menus</h1>

<h2>System</h2>
<menu>
	<li>Reboot - reboots the emulator, loading and running whatever
		boot disk is in unit 1.</li>
	<li>Auto Commit Writes - if checked, any change to those disks
		that are not marked ""Read Only" will occur immediately, so use
		caution.</li>
	<li>Full Speed - if checked, emulation will run as fast as
		possible, otherwise it will run close to the 4mhz original Z-80
		processor speed.</li>
	<li>Paused - pauses execution if checked. This will be checked
		automatically if you try to boot without a disk in unit 1.</li>
</menu>

<h2>Disks (turns red until there is no disk activity for more than
	5 seconds)</h2>
<menu>
	<li>Disk 1 - is the boot disk, allowing you to mount or unmount a
		disk image, as well as set if it is read/only or not.</li>
	<li>Disk 2-3/4 - are other disk images. Only the double density
		controller supports 4 drives, the single-density ends at 3.</li>
	<li>Create Disk - allows creating a blank disk image of one of the
		3 types: single-sided/single-density, single-sided/double-density or
		double-sided/double-density.</li>
</menu>

<h2>Display</h2>
<menu>
	<li>ScreenSplitter - controls options for the ScreenSplitter
		display, including which of two default character sets to use
		(Graphics or Scientific), color options for the video window, as well
		as which of three pixel sizes (small, medium, or large) to use.</li>
	<li>Text Console - Allows changing the colors, font type and size
		for the text console window</li>
</menu>

<h2>Help</h2>
<menu>
	<li>Contains basic information about the emulator, including this
